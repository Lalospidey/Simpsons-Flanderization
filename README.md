Flanderization of Homer Simpson
===============================

This directory contains the code and data for my attempt at evaluating whether Homer Simpsons has [Flanderized](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization). In particular, I evaluated Professor Pierce's claim that Homer Simpson has gotten dumber each season by examining Homer's (and the other Simpson family members') linguistic complexity over the course of 26 seasons. In this directory you will find the following files:

| File                                 | Description                                                                                                           |
